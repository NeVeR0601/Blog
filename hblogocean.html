<h1>What is the problem?</h1>
</div>
<br>
<h2>
Fact is that we got a problem with the environmental pollution. For example in Germany we produced over 14 million tons of plastic and at the moment 86 million tons of plasitc are swimming in the oceans. At some points in the oceans we got „plastic islands“ and some of them are for instance bigger than germany.  But why is this not good?
</h2>
<br>
<h2>
A thought experiment:
</h2>
<br><h2>
There are some problems resulting from this. Therefore just think about the following: Somebody throws his plastic bag in the ocean and now imagine what will happen with this. Maybe a fish will be trapped in this bag or much more worse he thinks that this is food and will eat it. What will happen to this fish? He could get sick and die or just stop eating. What will happen then? Maybe a fisherman will catch this fish and sell it to somebody. But this fish still has plastic inside. What will happen to the person who eat this fish? This person maybe will also get sick. And now just think that this is happening not only to one fish in the big ocean with only one plastic bag. Just remember that there are 86 million tons of plastic in our oceans.
</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
What other problems are emerging from this?
</h2>
<br>
<h2>
Not only we humans eat fish, also other fish, birds and mammals do this. And what will result from this? We will lose our populations and biodiversity and this in turn will damage our whole system.
</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Interim Conclusion: </h2> <br> <h2>
We damage ourselves when we throw our rubbish into the sea.
</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
What can we do against this problem?
</h2>
<h2>
<br>
We all can try to produce and use less plastic. This starts at the daily purchase. For example you should try to avoid everything which is unnecessarily packed up in plastic. Or you just bring your own bag to transport fruits and vegetables. There are some really good alternatives to a plastic bag.
The next level would be to invest in some start ups or something like this, with the aim to reduce the existing plastic in the oceans and our environment.
</h2>
<br>
<br>
<h2>
Conclusion:</h2> <br> <h2>
Plastic isn't that good and we will destroy ourselves if we don't start to use less and produce less of this. Sure in some cases plastic is the best thing and that's ok, but we should stop to use it where we don't need it. So just start with yourself and try to make our world to a better one. It's the only one we have.
