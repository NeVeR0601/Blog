<h1>Why our Ocean has a problem</h1>
</div>
<br>
<h2>We produced 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic, 6.3 billion metric tons has become plastic waste. There are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic waste estimated to be in our oceans. I mean I don't want to scare you but this is a lot! But why do we produce so much and why do we throw it into the ocean? The reason why we produce so much is that plastic packaging is so durable, plastic packaging can be very thin. This means it uses fewer resources and takes less space for transport which means fewer trucks, trains or planes are needed to transport it. And plastic can be transformed in many ways. There is nothing else which is so useful for packaging then plastic. The mankind does not know something better. That is the reason why we use it so much. But why do we throw it into the ocean? According to WWF there are three main ways the plastic we use every day ends up in the oceans. First way: Plastic which we put in bins ends up in landfill. When rubbish is being transported to landfill, plastic is often blown away because it's so lightweight. From there, it can eventually clutter around drains and enter rivers and the sea this way. Second way: Rubbish dropped on the street and rainwater and wind carries plastic waste into streams and rivers. It can also end up in drains which are leading in the ocean. Drains are also the third way how plastic can end up in our ocean because many of products which we use daily are flushed down toilets. Microfibers are even released into waterways when we wash our clothes in the washing machine. They are so tall that they can't be filtered out by waste water plants and end up being consumed by small marine species. Some Governments like the UK Government are banning the use of microbeads in cosmetic or cleaning products but there are also many other items which can be counted to the problem.</h2>
