<h1>How to safe the Ocean!</h1>
</div>
<br>
<h2>As you can read in the text: "Why our Ocean has a problem" we do have a huge plastic problem in our ocean. But what can we do against it? The first idea is to build a filter and get that plastic out of the water. But wait we got a problem we are not intelligent enough to build something like that on our own. Then we got our second option which is to pick up the plastic from our beaches. But it won't help us the microplastic is still in the water. And lastly we could invest our money properly in start-ups or existing industry which wants to do something against the problem. They will use your money to pay engineers and scientist for ideas and buildings which can work against the plastic. In my opinion we can help the industry and work with them against this big enemy.</h2>
